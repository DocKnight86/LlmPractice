# LlmPractice

Version 3

Local running large language models built into a Blazor App.

Requires .NET 9 and Docker running the Ollama docker image with llama3.1:8b and llama2:7b installed on port 11434

A future update will add support for deepseek-r1, gemma3 from Google, and phi4 from Microsoft. All open source.

https://hub.docker.com/r/ollama/ollama - Official Ollama Docker image.

All inspiration for this project came from: https://medium.com/scrum-and-coke/creating-a-web-api-with-net-9-to-interact-with-a-local-ollama-ai-instance-using-llama-3-1-41fcc3cceb8b

Quite a bit had already changed since the article was written, particularly with the Microsoft.Extensions.AI package, so it wasnâ€™t as simple as copying and pasting to get it working but the article pointed me in the right direction and got me thinking!

**Change Logs**

*Version 2 to version 3:*
- Now remembers parts of the conversation history so the models have some recall and ability to go back for context.
- Cleaned up some unused code.
- Fixed warnings produced on compile.
- Added asynchronous logging of chat messages to a local NDJSON file.
  - File can be found in the ChatHistory folder which will be created when first prompting the bot.
  - Will eventually allow for the reloading of past conversations or using ML.NET machine learning to better tokenize long running chats.
  - Will eventually be moved to a database, but this is easier for local running of the application.
- Added AppendChatMessageAsync function to serialize messages as JSON and append them to the file.
